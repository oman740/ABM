# This an agent based model
# built by me, and it is my first program ever
 Lets hope it works fine
 #Info abot the Model:
 Managed to build an Agent Based Model (ABM), which was my first experience in python, and in programming overall. It is basically a simple model that start with building 10 agents (randomly allocated) within "agentframework" moving around given space "environment" and interacting with it. The movement of the agents are plotted on the environment with a given iterations of 100. The model is given a simple graphical user interface to run it, and it was loaded with my GitHub
